      <h1>How to use the Tool</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Adding mirrors</u>: select two points on the grid that will mark
          the two endpoints of the mirror, and check the reflective checkbox
          whether you want it to be reflective or not. Note that mirrors can
          only be vertical, horizontal, or at 45°.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Adding ray</u>: select two points on the grid, where the first
          point indicates the starting point of the ray, and the second one the
          direction of the ray, relative to the previously selected starting
          point. Note that only one ray can be drawn at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Mapping</u>: executes the mapping algorithm.  Requires at least one mirror and a light
          ray.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Fire the ray</u>: draws the reflections of the chosen ray.
          The maximal number of reflections can be specified
          by in the <i>steps</i> input. Note that Mapping must be executed before Compute.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Tests</u>: three tests are available.
          <ol>
            <li>reproduces the environment given in the main reference</li>
            <li>creates a looping environment</li>
            <li>similar to the 1st test, but with a non-reflective surface</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Implementation</h1>
      <p>
        The visual part was implemented using the
        <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> library. The code of the
        implementation is available in the
        <a href="https://github.com/sswirydo/Ray-shooting/tree/main/code"
          >code/</a
        >
        folder of the repository. The most interesting part is in the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/sswirydo/Ray-shooting/tree/main/code/integerExchange.js"
          >integerExchange.js</a
        >
        file.
      </p>

      <h2>Main code details</h2>
      <p>
        <b>[<code>compute</code>]</b> Once the mirror environment has been built
        and the initial ray specified using the visual tool, the program loops
        all the mirrors in each possible ray direction (at most eight), and
        starts creating our list of bounce objects. The bounce objects represent
        each possible intersection between rays and mirrors in a given
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>[<code>getAllBouncesPerMirror</code>]</b> As the octagonal
        environment is represented in an integer space, the number of bounces is
        also finite. Per mirror, it is equal to the length of the mirror,
        defined by <code>max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2))</code>, and multiplied
        by either <code>abs(dir.x)</code>, <code>abs(dir.y)</code> or
        <code>abs(abs(dir.x) - abs(dir.y))</code>, respectively for vertical, horizontal and
        diagonal mirrors. Alongside, each (mirror, ray direction)
        tuple gets attributed an output direction for the outgoing ray,
        depending on the current input direction and the slope of the mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>[<code>addBounces</code>]</b> Using the output of the previous
        function, we create the bounces by first adding bounces corresponding to
        the mirror endpoints, then adding the reflective bounces alongside each
        mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>[<code>computeMapping, getNext</code>]</b>
        Finally, in order to map one bounce to another, we simply double loop
        each for each bounce and check
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          if their directions match, i.e. if the output direction of the first
          bounce equals the input direction of the second one
        </li>
        <li>if they are aligned (by a simple linear combination check)</li>
        <li>
          and in case 1) and 2) are both respected for multiple bounces, we
          simply take the nearest one by checking the euclidean distance
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>[<code>f (ray, n)</code>]</b> In order to trace the path of a given
        ray, we start by checking the first encountered bounce, then we simple
        follow the bounce mapping for at most <i>n</i> steps, jumping from one
        bounce to another.
      </p>

      <h2>Time complexity</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The creation of bounces runs in <code>O</code> of the number of
          mirrors multiplied by the number of ray directions (which equals 4 if
          the ray is grid aligned or at 45°, or 8 otherwise) and finally
          multiplied by the number of bounces per mirror (which is mainly
          determined by the slope of the ray)
        </li>
        <li>
          The mapping itself runs in <code>O</code> of the square of the number
          of bounces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally the ray shooting runs in <code>O</code> of the number of
          bounces in order to find the first bounce, then in <code>O</code> of
          the number of specified steps (<i>n</i>) in order to trace the path
          the ray travels.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Missing parts</h2>
      <p>
        Note that our tool does not completely implement the whole scope of the
        article, but rather allows to illustrate some important parts, such as
        the finite number of reflections, directions and its general idea. In
        order to obtain a complete implementation we would have to complement it
        with a reduction into a triangulated manifold and apply a series of
        subroutines from computational topology, that would potentially make the
        ray-shooting faster (although the construction would be longer), but the
        overall outcome of ray-shooting tool would not change. As this
        topological implementation is quite time consuming and does not bring
        much to the process and scope of this project (or at least visually), we
        preferred to focus on the <i>basis</i> of the tool and the
        popularization of concepts.

      <h1>Remarks and difficulties</h1>
      <p>
        The main difficulty in understanding Eppstein's article is its
        conciseness. Indeed, the article is very concise and does not always
        present examples to illustrate explanations, making understanding
        difficult for non-specialists in this field. For instance, most of the
        examples and proofs were generic rather than centered around the mirror
        problem itself.
      </p>
      <h2>Interval exchange</h2>
      <p>
        The article introduces the algorithm by saying that it allows to
        calculate the final output of the ray (i.e. absorbed, loops or escaped)
        without simulating all the bounces. It causes us some confusion when we
        were trying to understand the interval exchange transformation because
        we need to compute every possible bounces to construct the mapping.
        Therefore, we had some conceptual misunderstandings as to us it was
        like: "Instead of computing the bounces one-by-one, we compute a mapping
        of all the possible bounces" which seemed not better from our point of
        view. However, it is useful when we work in a static environment since
        we can compute the mapping only once and use the fast iterated interval
        exchange for all the rays.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        To keep it simple, we compute the mapping bounce-by-bounce in our
        implementation. However this is possible to optimize the construction
        time of the mapping by working with intervals. Indeed, by the nature of
        your problem, there is some piece-wise linearity and we can decompose it
        by mapping intervals. For example, if we have 2 points A and C put on a
        first mirror that reflects the ray respectively towards X and Z on a
        second mirror, then a bounce B between A and C will be reflected towards
        a point Y between X and Z.

      <h2>Topology</h2>
      <!-- We believe that surface triangulation is not always necessary. (+develop) -->
      <p>
        The main paper does not expand on the topological part and simply says
        that the problem of the iterated interval exchange transformation can be
        reduce to a well-known problem of following paths on a normal curve on a
        triangulated surface. Moreover, he mentions that this path-following
        problem can be solved by the Erickson and Nayyeri's algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this last paragraph alone is not comprehensible when we do not
        have background knowledge about topology. Hopefully, thanks to another
        Eppstein's paper<sup><a href="#sourceMain" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and the
        Erickson and Nayyeri's paper<sup
          ><a href="#sourceErickson" id="ref2">2</a></sup
        >
        we obtain extra information about the flow and construction of the
        algorithm, as well as clarification about topological vocabulary such as
        the difference between edge and arc coordinates as well as the meaning
        of normal curve and normal arc.
      </p>

      <h2>Interval, subinterval and sub-subinterval</h2>
      <p>
        A final difficulty encountered during reading concerns the ambiguity
        caused by similar words like "interval", "subinterval" and
        "subsubinterval" without clearly labelling those words with physical
        objects in our problem which sometimes make comprehension a bit tricky.
