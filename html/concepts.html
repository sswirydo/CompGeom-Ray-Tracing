      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        We have a ray of light, a set of octagonal mirrors and non-reflective
        surfaces, living in a integer grid world. The question we want to respond,
        is to know where shooting the light ray will bring it up.
        Will it escape the the mirror labyrinth, be absorbed at some point,
        or perhaps will it loop infinitely?
      </p>

      <p>
        The main idea behind the algorithm is,
        in an octagonal mirror integer environnement,
        to map each possible mirror position at which a ray of light can reflect,
        with the corresponding mirror position towards which the ray has been reflected.
        As we will see, this mapping is called an <strong>integer interval exchange transformation</strong>,
        noted <code>f(x)</code>, as we will permute intervals of integers to obtain the previously evoked mapping.
        Therefore, in order to obtain a ray's direction and position after <code>n</code> reflections/bounces
        we will simply have to apply <code>n</code> times this exchange transformation.
        The process of applying the exchange <code>n</code> times is called an
        <strong><u>iterated</u> integer interval exchange transformation</strong>,
        noted <code>f<sup>(n)</sup>(x)</code>.
        An optimized version, called <strong><u>fast</u> iterated exchange transformation</strong>,
        allows to compute the result of the <code>n</code><sup>th</sup> iteration without computing all
        of the intermediate exchanges, by using concepts from computational
        topology.
        <!-- (i.e. instead of doing 2+2+2 we will do 2*3) -->
        <!-- (i.e. it is like a function g(n,x) = f<sup>(n)</sup>(x)). -->
      </p>

      <h2>Hypotheses</h2>
      <p>
        In the real world, there is an infinite number of possible reflections.
        Therefore to apply this kind algorithm we need to define some
        assumptions to simplify the problem:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mirrors' starting and ending points have integer coordinates.</li>
        <li>
          Mirrors can only be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (at 45°)
          regarding the grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ray is represented as a vector, whose starting position and
          direction are specified by integer values.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mirrors' endpoints (i.e. the start and end positions of each mirror
          segment) do not reflect the ray. When a ray hits such points it is
          absorbed and thus stops its journey.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        With this established, we obtain some simple but important properties:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Since the mirrors have only 4 possible slopes, all our rays can be
          reflected in at most 8 possible directions: we can just negate or/and exchange the
          x and y coordinates of the vector depending on the mirror slope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Given a ray going in a specified direction, it can hit any mirror in
          only a finite number of positions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The space in which a ray of light lives does not change after a reflection.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Therefore, it means there is a finite and numerable number of possible
        bounces in an octagonal mirror environnement making this algorithm
        computable.
      </p>
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>
        Following those hypotheses, we will obtain a system like represented by
        the image below. The ray starts at coordinates <code>(7,3)</code> (red circle) with
        an direction <code>(-1,-2)</code>. It is reflected by mirrors, that are represented
        by the blue lines, and escape through the right-down corner. Note that
        the blue circles represent all the possible positions that a light ray
        could reach by bouncing towards its 8 possibles directions.

      <h1>Integer interval exchange transformation</h1>
      <p>
        An integer interval exchange transformation consists in dividing an
        interval of integers into subintervals, then permuting those
        subintervals.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        In our mirror problem, the integer interval exchange transformation
        divides mirrors (intervals) into bounces (integers), which are all the
        possible places where a light ray can hit a mirror, then permutes them
        in order to obtain the next bounce. One can easily calculate the number
        of possible bounces, which are equally-distributed, on an unit mirror
        according to its orientation and the ray's direction <code>(x,y)</code> (e.g. <code>|x|</code> for
        vertical mirror, <code>|y|</code> for horizontal mirror, <code>|x-y|</code> or <code>|x + y|</code> for a
        mirror oriented at 45°, depending on the slopes).
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore it creates a bijective mapping between bounces. This bijective
        property is really important. Indeed, it allows to guarantee a solution exists
        when applying <code>n</code> times the exchange transformation, as we want the
        transformation to cycle.
      </p>

          principle of interval exchange transformation but is not a real
          example of our problem since a mirror cannot reflect on itself.
          (Figure from "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11607.pdf"

      <p>
        As a reminder, the idea of a <strong>bijection</strong> is, given input
        and output sets, to join each input element to one and only one output
        element and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        To construct the integer interval exchange transformation, we need a
        single big interval. In order to obtain one, we will align all mirrors
        together, where each mirror will form a subinterval. As a light ray can
        hit a mirror from at most eight possible directions, we will multiply
        that mirror interval by at most eight, in order to obtain distinct
        <code>(mirror, incoming ray slope)</code> tuples.
        <!-- ! technically we could/should divide the big mirror interval by considering the subsubintervals → by where it will go next -->
      </p>

          all the possible ray's directions.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Afterwards, we can further subdivide those mirror intervals into subintervals,
        depending on which next-mirror each initial-mirror would send the ray after reflection.
        For instance, if one part of the blue mirror sends a ray on the green mirror,
        and the second part on the yellow mirror,
        we could subdivide the blue mirror interval into two blue-to-green and blue-to-yellow subintervals.
      </p>

      <h1>Partial integer interval exchange</h1>
      <p>
        In order for our mirror problem to be full expressed as a bijection in
        the exchange transformation, we need to handle some additional cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What happens to a ray that bounces out of a mirror environnement, i.e.
          it manages to escape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where should we map a light ray that hits a mirror endpoint or a
          non-reflective surface.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When a mirror reflects a light ray out of the environnement, it is not
        mapped to a next bounce as by definition it manages to escape. In order
        to handle the <strong>outgoing rays</strong>, we simply surround the
        environnement with an absorbing bounding box. Then we can considered
        that the outgoing ray is mapped to a non-reflective surface on the
        border of the environnement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>non-reflective</strong> surfaces and endpoints break the
        bijection of the integer interval exchange transformation. To solve this
        problem we simply <i>virtually</i> map a non-reflective surface as if it
        was reflective, and a mirror's endpoint as if it flipped the ray back in
        the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, we obtain a bijective mapping. However, this mapping is
        logically incorrect since we ignore the non-reflective property of those
        surfaces. The <strong>partial</strong> integer interval exchange solves
        this problem by extending the initial interval with
        <i>infinite</i> traps. Once a light ray hits a non reflective surface,
        it will first map it to the start of a trap, before mapping it out of
        the trap as explained in the previous paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that it is useless to apply the interval exchange transformation
        more times than the total number of bounces n, which otherwise would
        involve going through the same bounce (same direction and same position)
        at least twice, meaning we looped. Therefore, a n-depth trap is
        considered to be <i>infinite</i> since we will not compute more than n
        steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, the partial integer interval exchange proposes to add,
        for a ray that hits a non-reflective element, a new trap element
        in-between this non-reflective element and its hypothetical reflection
        where the ray would go if the surface was actually reflective.
        Consequently, we obtain a complete bijective mapping for all bounces and
        we are sure that non-reflective element or not map to a reflective
        element in less than n steps.

      <h1>Fast iterated interval exchange using topology</h1>

      <p>
        In order to make the iterated exchange process faster, the proposed idea
        is to reduce the exchange transformation into a problem of computational
        topology.
      </p>

      <h2>Interval exchange as triangulated surface</h2>
      <p>
        As illustrated by the image below, the idea is to place the initial
        integer interval at the top, and its corresponding permutation
        (exchange) at the bottom. Then, we glue each subinterval with its
        corresponding subinterval after permutation (i.e per label). For
        instance, the first subinterval at the top labelled by <b>a</b> will be
        joined with the last bottom subinterval <b>a</b>. As those intervals are
        composed of integers (integer interval), we will make those integers
        (i.e bounces) stand out by drawing a vertical blue line from a top's
        integer to its corresponding integer at the bottom. In the example, as
        the integer range goes from 0 to 14 (from left to right), we thus have
        15 blue lines. Descending this line vertically from a certain integer,
        will give its corresponding permuted value at the bottom. Thus, starting
        from number 0 at the top (<b>a</b> subinterval, first blue line), we
        will descend into the <b>b</b> subinterval, giving the number 4. If you
        follow this idea recursively (descending from 4 onto <b>d</b> and
        obtaining 9, etc.), you will end up back at your starting position as
        the exchange is a bijection and thus cyclic. All those blue lines,
        according to our previous glueing, actually form a single blue line
        called the <span class="normal_curve">normal curve</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Note that an exchange can have multiple cycles, in that case we will say
        that a <span class="normal_curve">normal curve</span> is composed of
        multiple <span class="normal_arc">normal arcs</span>. But for now, we
        will only focus on a single cycle as in the illustrated example.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, the surface is divided into a certain number of horizontal lines,
        and triangulated in such a way that each blue line crosses only one
        diagonal triangle edge between two consecutive horizontal lines. To be
        more precise, the surface must have a central horizontal line (edge)
        that will have only two vertices, placed on its borders (or a single
        vertex if we view the surface as glued by its vertical borders). The
        goal will be to add enough horizontal lines in between such that the
        above's property about blue lines and triangle edges is respected.
      </p>

          actually represent mirror subintervals, as it maps a part of the
          <b>d</b> subinterval back to <b>d</b>, but the overall idea remains
          the same. (Figure from "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11607.pdf"
            >The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation</a
          >")

      <h2>Traversing the normal curve</h2>

      <p>
        Consider mainly the middle horizontal edge of the surface and also the
        blue <span class="normal_curve">normal curve</span>. We start at a
        certain x-position of the horizontal edge, that correspond to the
        initial number we want to iterate: x in f<sup>(n)</sup>(x). This
        x-position is of an edge called the
        <span class="edge_coord">edge coordinates</span>, From there, basically,
        the idea is to convert those
        <span class="edge_coord">edge coordinates</span> into
        <span class="arc_coord">arc coordinates</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        <span class="arc_coord">Arc coordinates</span> represent the i<sup
          >th</sup
        >
        edge that a <span class="normal_arc">normal arc</span> has crossed since
        an arbitrary initial starting position.
      </p>
      <p>Once those are obtained, we add '<b>2ns</b>' to those coordinates.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          '<b>n</b>' is the number of iterations we want to execute (recall
          f<sup>(n)</sup>(x)).
        </li>
        <li>
          '<b>s</b>' is the number of edges crossed from the horizontal central
          edge to the horizontal top edge (4 in our example), which we multiply
          by 2 in order to obtain the number of edges crossed from top to
          bottom.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We modulo the whole operation as the
        <span class="arc_coord">arc coordinates</span> are cyclic by definition.
        Then, we simply convert back the
        <span class="arc_coord">arc coordinates</span> to the
        <span class="edge_coord">edge coordinates</span> in order to obtain the
        final result of the iteration. For example, if we initialized the
        <span class="arc_coord">arc coordinates</span> to be the edge labelled
        by <b>a</b>, the <span class="edge_coord">edge coordinates</span> x = 0
        converted into <span class="arc_coord">arc coordinates</span> would be
        4. By computing 4 + 2s (where s = 4), we obtain
        <span class="arc_coord">arc coordinates</span> 12, which converted back
        to the <span class="edge_coord">edge coordinates</span> give us x = 4 as
        seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        However in our mirror problem, there could have several cycles and thus
        multiple <span class="normal_arc">normal arcs</span>. In order to take
        those into account, retain simply that we have to apply additional
        topological subroutines, in order to first determine to which
        <span>normal arc</span> our x value belongs and convert the value to the
        arc's scope. The conversion between coordinates can be obtained through
        algorithms presented in the section 6 of the "<a
          href="https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/pubs/pdf/tracing.pdf"
          >Tracing Compressed Curves in Triangulated Surfaces</a
