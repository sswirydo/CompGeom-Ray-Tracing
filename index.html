      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        This page was created in the context of the “INFO-F420 - Computational
        Geometry” course at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), and taught by
        Stefan LANGERMAN. The goal of the project is to read and understand one
        or several recent research articles in computational geometry, related
        to the topic of choice. A creative work must be implemented
        demonstrating our deep understanding of the concepts described in the
        articles we read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our group choose to study the "<a
          href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11413.pdf"
          >Reflections in an octagonal mirror maze</a
        >" article by D. Eppstein.
      </p>

      <h2>Sections</h2>
      <p>The webpage is organized into following sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/Ray-shooting/html/concepts.html">Concepts</a>: attempts to summarize and
          popularize the studied articles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/Ray-shooting/html/code.html">Code</a>: contains the description of our
          implementation as well as some personal remarks regarding the overall
          project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/Ray-shooting/html/tool.html">Tool</a>: presents a tool allowing to explore
          some ideas of the read articles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/Ray-shooting/html/references.html">References</a>: bibliography part.
        </li>
      </ul>

        As we were a small group, the work was not distributed and was done
        following the pair-programming principle.
