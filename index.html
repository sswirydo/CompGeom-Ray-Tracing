    <h1>INFO-F420 Computational Geometry Project</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      This page was created in the context of the “INFO-F420 - Computational Geometry” course at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB),
      and taught by Stefan LANGERMAN.
      The goal of the project is to read and understand one or several recent research articles in computational geometry, related to the topic of choice.
      A creative work must be implemented demonstrating our deep understanding of the concepts described in the articles we read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our group choose to study the "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11413.pdf">Reflections in an octagonal mirror maze</a>" article by D. Eppstein.
    </p>


    <h2>Sections</h2>
      <p>
        The webpage is organized into following sections:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="html/concepts.html">Concepts</a>: attempts to summarize and popularize the studied articles.</li>
          <li><a href="html/code.html">Code</a>: contains the description of our implementation as well as some personal remarks regarding the overall project.</li>
          <li><a href="html/tool.html">Tool</a>: presents a tool allowing to explore some ideas of the read articles.</li>
          <li><a href="html/references.html">References</a>: bibliography part.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        As we were a small group, the work was not distributed
        and was done following the pair-programming principle.

    <h2>Progress</h2>

      Currently, we have implemented a basic tool
      that allows to compute the reflections of a light ray
      in an octagonal mirror integer-environnement.

      We have started the explanations of the concepts of the article,
      and we essentially still need to add some important points,
      illustrate different parts, and mostly add some pertinent
      images and figures to better illustrate the ideas.

      However note that our tool does not completely implement
      the whole scope of the article, but rather allows
      to illustrate some important parts, such as the finite
      number of reflections, directions and its general idea.

      In order to obtain a complete implementation we would have
      to complement it with a reduction into a
      triangulated manifold and apply a series of subroutines
      from computational topology, that would potentially
      make the whole algorithm faster (actually we
      are not certain of that point), but the overall
      outcome of ray-shooting would not change.

      As this topological implementation is quite time consuming
      (and we are not even sure we would be able to
      code it in such short time), and does not bring
      much, at least visually, to the whole process,
      we will just focus on explaining its concepts.
