# Context

This repository was created in the context of the “INFO-F420 - Computational Geometry” course at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB).

The goal of the project is to read and understand one or several recent research articles in computational geometry, related to the topic of choice. A creative work must be implemented demonstrating our deep understanding of the concepts described in the articles we read.
